Exercise can be found [here]

## Description
This function count takes a DNA sequence as input and returns the count of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) present in the sequence. It initializes counters for each nucleotide to zero and iterates through the sequence, incrementing the corresponding counter for each nucleotide encountered. Finally, it returns a string containing the counts of A, C, G, and T nucleotides in the sequence, separated by spaces.
