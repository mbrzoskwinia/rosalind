## Description
This function, fib, calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence with a specified step size. It utilizes memoization to store previously computed values for efficiency. The function takes two parameters: n, representing the index of the term to be calculated, and k, representing the step size for the Fibonacci sequence (default is 1). The function returns the value of the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence with the given step size.
