## Description
This function calculates the probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). It takes three positive integers, k, m, and n, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms, where k individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive. The function assumes that any two organisms can mate.
